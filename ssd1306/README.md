# SSD1306 OLED Driver

This is a common OLED driver chip.

I used this specific display (the Blue & Yellow): [UMLIFE 0.96" 7 Pin SPI 128x64 OLED Display](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SJY4RC4?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)

Note: This is really a monochrome display with top ~20% showing up yellow and the rest blue.  The pictures on Amazon are *misleading* to say the least.
